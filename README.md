# New Projects
 I have to stop making new repositories for everything. Going forward, this is the projects respository for all medium/small projects.


Projects:

**1. League of Legends Draft:** The goal of this project is to develop optimal champion drafting strategies to maximize win probability in competitive League of Legends setting. It comprises of two models: i) a predictive model to predict win-probability for Blue-side team and (future plan) ii) a multi-agent reinforcement learning model where both sides play repeated drafts to learn strategies (which champion to choose from, which order to pick etc.) to maximize final win-probability.
